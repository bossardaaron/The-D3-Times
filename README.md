# Data Journalism and D3

## Summary

Sifted through health risk information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in CSV files. It contains data on rates of income, obesity, poverty and other information by state. By using D3, created interactive scatter plots and represented each U.S. state with circle elements. The plots show obesity percentage, percentage of smokers, percentage lacking healthcare on the y-axis and percentage in poverty, median age and median household income on the x-axis. 

Used `python -m http.server` to run the visualization, hosting the page at `localhost:8000` in my web browser.
